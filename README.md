I purchased a Nest thermostat, and frankly I was disappointed that it failed to adjust humidity when the outside temperature dropped below the condensation level.  This service provides a couple of hacks that enable some cool features on the Nest thermostat.
* Automatically adjust the humidity set point preventing condensation when outside temperature drops.
* When the thermostat is controlling a humidifier, adds a humidity control to the thermostat faceplate.
* Track and store metrics reported for each thermostat.
