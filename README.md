I purchased a Nest thermostat, and frankly I was disappointed that it failed to adjust humidity when the outside temperature dropped below the condensation level.  This service provides a couple of hacks that enable some cool features on the Nest thermostat.
* Track and store metrics reported for each thermostat.
* Automatically adjust the humidity set point for outside temperature.

## Installation
1. npm install
